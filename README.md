<h1>header files</h1> : 
A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.

C language

#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
  printf ("hello, world");
}

functions: A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.
